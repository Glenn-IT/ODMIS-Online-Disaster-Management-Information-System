# Backend & Database Implementation Checklist

**Project:** ODMIS — Online Disaster Management Information System
**Stack:** PHP 8.x · MySQL 8.x · REST API · JWT Auth
**Environment:** XAMPP (Windows)

---

## Phase 1 — Environment & Project Setup

- [x] Verify XAMPP is running Apache 2.4+ and MySQL 8.x — PHP 8.2.12 · MariaDB 10.4.32
- [x] Create MySQL database: `odmis_db`
- [ ] ~~Create a dedicated DB user with limited privileges (not root)~~ — Skipped: `mysql.db` Aria table corrupted on local XAMPP; using `root` for dev. Fix before production.
- [x] Create `/api/` folder at project root for all backend endpoints
- [x] Create `/config/` folder for DB connection and constants
- [x] Create `/uploads/` folder for user photo uploads (set permissions)
- [x] Install Composer (PHP dependency manager) — v2.9.5
- [x] Install PHP libraries via Composer:
  - [x] `firebase/php-jwt` v7.1.0 — JWT token generation and verification
  - [ ] ~~`PHPMailer/PHPMailer`~~ — Skipped (email feature not needed)
  - [x] `mpdf/mpdf` v8.3.1 — PDF report generation
- [x] Create `config/env.php` for secrets (DB credentials, JWT secret, upload limits)
- [x] Add `config/env.php` to `.gitignore`
- [x] Create `config/database.php` — PDO connection singleton (tested ✅)
- [x] Constants merged into `config/env.php` (JWT expiry, upload limits, app URL)
- [x] Create `api/helpers/response.php` — standard JSON response helper (`success()`, `error()`)
- [x] Create `api/middleware/auth.php` — JWT verification middleware (`require_auth()`, `require_admin()`)
- [x] Enable CORS headers in `api/.htaccess` + OPTIONS preflight handler

---

## Phase 2 — Database Schema

### 2.1 Users Table
- [x] Create `users` table:
  ```sql
  id, username (unique), email (unique), password_hash,
  role (enum: admin/user), full_name, contact_number,
  date_of_birth, address, status (enum: active/inactive),
  security_question, security_answer_hash, created_at, updated_at
  ```
- [x] Add unique index on `username` and `email`

### 2.2 Disaster Incidents Table

  ```sql
  id, incident_code (unique), disaster_type, title, description,
  location, barangay, municipality, incident_date, incident_time,
  severity (enum: Low/Moderate/High/Critical), status (enum: Active/Resolved),
  reported_by, created_at, updated_at
  ```

### 2.3 Evacuation Centers Table
- [x] Create `evacuation_centers` table:
  ```sql
  id, center_code (unique), center_name, location, barangay,
  capacity, occupied_slots, contact_person, contact_number,
  status (enum: Open/Closed), created_at, updated_at

  relief_type, quantity, unit, status (enum: Pending/In Progress/Completed),
  distributed_by, notes, created_at, updated_at
  ```

### 2.5 Announcements Table

  ```sql
  id, title, body, category, published_by (FK → users.id),
  published_at, is_active, created_at, updated_at
  ```

### 2.6 Disaster Alerts Table
- [x] Create `disaster_alerts` table:
  ```sql
  id, alert_type, title, description, affected_areas,
  severity (enum: Low/Moderate/High/Critical), status (enum: Active/Resolved),
  issued_by (FK → users.id), issued_at, expires_at, created_at, updated_at
  ```

### 2.7 User Reports Table

- [x] Write SQL seed file: `database/seeds/001_sample_data.sql` (ported from mock-data.js, passwords bcrypt-hashed)
- [x] Test: migrations and seeds ran successfully on `odmis_db` — 5 users · 10 incidents · 5 evac centers · 8 relief ops · 6 announcements · 6 alerts ✅

---

## Phase 3 — Authentication API

- [x] `POST /api/auth/login.php`
  - Validate username + password against `users` table
  - Compare password with `password_verify()` (bcrypt) ✅
  - Return JWT token + user role on success ✅
  - Return 401 on failure (generic message — no username hint) ✅
- [x] `POST /api/auth/register.php`
  - Validate all fields server-side (length, email format, PH phone) ✅
  - Check username and email uniqueness in DB ✅
  - Hash password with `password_hash()` (PASSWORD_BCRYPT) ✅
  - Hash security answer (lowercased before hashing) ✅
  - Insert new user (role = 'user', status = 'active') ✅
  - Return success + JWT ✅
- [x] `POST /api/auth/forgot-password.php`
  - Step 1: Verify username exists → return security question ✅
  - Step 2: Verify security answer hash (case-insensitive) ✅
  - Step 3: Hash and update new password ✅
- [x] `POST /api/auth/logout.php` — validates token then acknowledges (client deletes JWT) ✅
- [x] `GET /api/auth/me.php` — return current user profile from JWT ✅
- [x] Rate limiting on login: 5 attempts per 15 min per IP (file-based cache) ✅
- [x] Lockout clears automatically after 15-minute window ✅

---

## Phase 10 — Security Hardening

- [ ] Add CSRF token generation and validation on all state-changing forms
- [ ] Sanitize all inputs with `htmlspecialchars()` and `filter_var()` on the backend
- [ ] Use PDO prepared statements for all DB queries (no raw string concatenation)

- [ ] Store uploaded files outside webroot or behind authenticated routes

---

## Phase 11 — Testing

- [ ] Test all API endpoints with a REST client (Postman or Insomnia)
- [ ] Test CRUD operations for each entity (create, read, update, delete)
- [ ] Test auth: valid login, wrong password, inactive user, expired JWT
- [ ] Test role enforcement: user cannot access admin endpoints
- [ ] Test report exports: PDF and CSV download correctly
- [ ] Test photo upload: valid image passes, non-image file rejected
- [ ] Test forgot-password: wrong username, wrong answer, successful reset
- [ ] Verify all chart data is accurate after seeding
- [ ] Regression test all admin pages after removing mock-data.js
- [ ] Regression test all user pages after removing mock-data.js
- [ ] Test on minimum 1366px desktop (admin) and mobile (user module)

---

## Phase 12 — Deployment Prep

- [ ] Import `odmis_db` via mysqldump to production server
- [ ] Update `.env` with production DB, SMTP, and JWT credentials
- [ ] Set `display_errors = Off` in `php.ini` for production
- [ ] Set up daily automated MySQL backups
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is enforced on all routes
- [ ] Remove `docs/Prompt.md` and other dev-only files from production build
- [ ] Document admin credentials and handoff to DRRM Office IT staff
